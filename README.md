# Petition
A playful petition on politics in the Korean Peninsula. I built this at Spiced Academy during week 7 of the 12-week course on Javascript-focused web development. Check out a live demo [here](https://aleesteele-petition.herokuapp.com/) and the rest of my web-development portfolio [here](https://github.com/aleesteele/portfolio).

## Technologies
- **Language**: Javascript
- **Frontend**: jQuery, Handlebars
- **Backend**: Express
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL

## Overview
This project was built in order to learn how to integrate the Handlebars templating engine with Express & jQuery.

## Preview

After logging in, they have the option to input more information such as their city, country, age, and more.

Once the user has logged in, they have the option of signing a petition by drawing on a canvas. This signature is encrypted and stored in database.

However, once the user has signed the petition, they are redirected to a playful "thank you" page, which tells them that their signature has actually been for naught.


## Improvements
- Edit for error in 'more-info'
